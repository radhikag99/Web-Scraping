**Web-Scraping-RSS-Feeds

This python file is used to scrape podcasts from websites.

RSS Feeds are XML-based syndication format files that store information related to the webite. Websites use RSS feeds to publish updates made to websites when a new magazine is launched or a new podcast is launced so that the audience can be notified about these events. 


The input to this script is the link to the podcast website and the number of episodes that need to be downloaded. 
The output produced is the podcast audio that is stored in a local folder.
